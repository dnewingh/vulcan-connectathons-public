Mock resources are organized into sub-directories, where each sub-directory maps to a test case outlined on sharepoint (https://phuseaccount.sharepoint.com/sites/InvestigatingtheuseofFHIRinClinicalResearch/Shared%20Documents/General/2023-1%20Connectathon/202301%20Patient%20Screening%20with%20Vulcan-SoA%20Test%20Script.xlsx?web=1)
